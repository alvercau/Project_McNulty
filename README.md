## Scenario

The city of New York wants to optimize their bike sharing system. A common problem is that some bike stations are often full, which requires the users to find another bike station in the neighbourhood to park their bike. Riders might not be too happy with that, since it causes them to loose time. Another problem is that sometimes bike stations are empty, so riders have to go to a nearby bike station to get a bike, again, causing them to waste time. If we get a better idea of the flow of bikes, we can anticipate these types of problems and move bikes from stations that are close to overflooding to stations that are close to emptying. This requires some logistics (trucks, drivers, etc.), which should be optimized. If we know where bikes go, we can do counter-current relocations of bikes.

## Question
Where do shared bikes go?
